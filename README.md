# react-portfolio

## Description
This is the first project I have made using react. It is a portfolio website with information about me, a way to contact me, links to my projects and their repositories, and my resume that can be downloaded.
        
## Usage
This is used to present myself to employers, providing them my contacts, my projects, and a little information about myself.
